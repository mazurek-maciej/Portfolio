Below are technologies that I'm currently mostly delve into.<br/> In the next
stage of my learning journey I want to get better knowledge in: Node.js,
Webpack, Express, MongoDB, Jest and many more that will appear.<br/> In the
meantime I'm also learning how to create beautiful UI designs. For mockups and
graphics I'm using Sketch.
