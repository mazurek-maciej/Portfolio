Below are technologies that I'm currently mostly delve into.<br/> But in the
next stage of my learning journey I want to get better knowledge in: Node.js,
Webpack, Express, MongoDB, Jest and many more that will appear.<br/> In the
meantime I'm also learning create UI designs. For mockups and graphics I'm use
Sketch.
