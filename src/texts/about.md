My name is Maciej Mazurek and since July 2018 I have started my journey to
become front-end developer.<br/> Systematic work, pursuing to achive goal and
willing to learn new technologies are my main assets.<br/> Currently I'm in love
with the React, so most of my time is dedicated to this framework.
